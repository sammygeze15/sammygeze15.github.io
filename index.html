            <p class="text">
              We realised that these small clothes selling boutiques are limited to the market provided by the people that 
              live around them locally hence they dont get as much profit 
              <p>
              We also found out that these boutiques usually are not informed of the fashion trends today hence they lose market 
              from the present generation

            <p class="text">
              We decided to create an application that allows these small boutiques to get exposed to the various locations 
              around the country 
              <p>
                We are also making a way in which these boutiques can learn more about what kind of fashion is currently trending 
                to attract market from from the current generation which will in turn increase their market
              </p>
            </p>

            <img class="image image-wrap-text max-width-400" src="img/survey1.jpg">
            This is the first thing the user sees after they have created an account to get their taste of fashion,
            this information is then to be passed to the boutiques owners

            <img class="image image-wrap-text max-width-400" src="img/survey2.jpg">
            As you can see this queston tries to collect the information of which category of age you are to understand 
            what each specific age group prefers to wear

            This is where most of the application's features are located since it's the home page of the whole application.
            One can even be able to like a cloth and add it to their favourites list
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <img class="image image-wrap-text max-width-400" src="img/addcloth.jpg">
            After tapping the add icon on the home page this feature enables a business to put up there clothes for sale for the user to see and pick what they would 
            like to select

            This image shows the process of adding a cloth to the application these images of each cloth along with their prices 
            will then be depicted on the home page

            Here is where you check out  your profile or even as a user one can check what they added to their cart so far

            <img class="image image-wrap-text max-width-400" src="img/first.jpeg">
            Here is where the clothes you have put in your cart are seen from. Auser can also remove the product from the cart 
            if he or she changes their mind about the cloth

            When one decides to pick an item to buy and proceeds to buy it he or she can decide to pay using mobile money 
            hence we patnered with flutter wave to deliver mobile money payment as an option
